          <h3>Magma is a collaborative drawing software for browsers. You can either draw alone or invite others by sending a link. You must have a "nickname" of some sort to tell who is who. You also have a colour assigned to you (Can be changed) and your own animal (Can be randomized). An account ISN'T required, but it's recommended, as you can have; drawings saved to your account and not losing it when you don't have the link, your <span class="noto-emoji">✨</span> quirky <span class="noto-emoji">✨</span> and <span class="noto-emoji">✨</span> (totally) aesthetically <span class="noto-emoji">✨</span> pleasing picture as your profile picture... Etcetera... Yah...</h3>
