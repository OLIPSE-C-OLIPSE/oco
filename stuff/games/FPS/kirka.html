          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Kirka is a browser-based voxel FPS game developed by Pierre-Éli. (Guessing from CrazyGames) the game is available to play on Kirka's own website, but is also playable on CrazyGames. Accounts are optional but there is no way to sign in or create an account through e-mail, you have to use a connection to make or sign into an account. If you don't decide to log in, you can simply play as a guest. Gameplay is simple, run around and kill players; though there are other gamemodes that add more to just killing players.</p>
